# Website.

### This repository has the files required for hosting my static website. Any changes to the website are pushed to his repository which in turn updates the statically hosted websites on Amazon [S3](http://kartik-reddy.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com) and on [Github](https://pajkouisn.github.io/Website/). You can also view this on a user friendly domain [www.kartik-reddy.com].
